Facade

* Story 

Facade hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client from where the client can access the system.

You want to organize a marriage reception with dinner for 100 people. 
So in order to organize such event, you need to find and decorate a hall where the event will happen, 
then you need to find a music, organize flowers, send invitations and so on and so on.

If this to much for you than you can find event manager and tell him that you need a hall decorated with flowers, 
dinner for 100 people, and need a good music troop to play music while the reception is going on. 

This is a typical example for Facade.
