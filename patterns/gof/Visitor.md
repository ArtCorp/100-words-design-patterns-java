Visitor

Allows for one or more operations to be applied to a set of objects at runtime, decoupling the operations from object structure.

Shopping in supermarket is example of the Visitor pattern. 
You pick a products and put them in shopping cart. When you get to the checkout, the cashier acts as a visitor, taking the 
disparate set of elements, some with prices and others that needs to be weighted, in order to provide you with total.
