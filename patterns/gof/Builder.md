### Story 

Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

This pattern is used by PC shops to contruct PC's.
PC is combination of various parts like CPU, motherboard, memory, storage, power supply, video card, etc.
To build a PC same construction process is used even for each part we have different variation.
Whether a customer picks a classical hard disk or SSD for storage, the construction process is the same.
