###  <a id="Motivation"></a>Motivation 

Imagine that we need to develop a flight simulator. Our flight simulator will have base artifacts, like airport and aircraft. 
An aircraft can take off from the airport, fly in the sky and land on the airport.


Imagine a scenario when one particular aircraft is landing on the airport: how can that aircraft be sure that the other aircrafts are not 
trying to land on the same airport at the same time? It is obvious that our aircraft can't talk to each and every aircraft which is currently 
approaching the airport.


A better approach would be to introduce a mediator, which is a "man in the middle", meaning that all the aircrafts will communicate only with the mediator. 
The task of ensuring the safe operations of the aircrafts belongs to air traffic controllers, who are mediators. 
They must coordinate the movements of all the aircrafts, keep them at safe distances from each other, direct them during takeoff and landing, 
direct them around bad weather and ensure that the air traffic flows smoothly with minimal delays.


The example above is a Mediator pattern. The Mediator pattern defines an object that controls how a set of objects interacts.

A Radio Taxi is an example of the Mediator pattern. 
The taxi drivers communicate with the Mediator (Radio Taxi Call Center), rather than with each other.


When a customer needs a taxi, he calls the Radio Taxi Call Center. 
All taxis have GPS units, which tell the Radio Taxi Call Center the taxis' current locations; there is also a central information system, 
which tells which taxi is currently available to serve the customer. 
The call center will contact the available taxi nearest to customerâ€™s location and send it to serve the customer.

###  <a id="Structure"></a>Structure 

A *Colleague* defines an interface for communication with another *Colleague* via the *Mediator*. 
For the *ConcreteColleague* class, each *Colleague* class knows its *Mediator* object, and each *Colleague* communicates with its mediator 
whenever it would have otherwise communicated with another colleague. 
The *Mediator* defines an interface for communicating with *Colleague* objects. 
The *ConcreteMediator* implements cooperative behavior by coordinating the *Colleague* objects.

#### *ConcreteColleague1.java* 
```java

#### *Mediator.java* 
```java

/**
 * Mediator defines an interface for communicating with Colleague objects.
 *
 */
public interface Mediator {

#### *ConcreteMediator.java* 
```java 
package com.hundredwordsgof.mediator;
