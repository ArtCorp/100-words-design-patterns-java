## Story 

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
Group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. 

Lego brick represents Composite pattern. 
A brick is a basic object, but on a same time brick is a container which can hold other bricks in order to construct complex objects.
