Welcome to Design Patterns Stories site.

Idea behind this site is to describe GoF Design Patterns on a simple way. 

Each pattern is described using following triad:

* **Understand**: describes a pattern with story from real life
* **Implement**: referent implementation of the pattern
* **Apply**: discuss where pattern can be(or is) applied

If you are a junior developer, and want to learn Design Patterns, these site is the place to start.  
If you are an intermediate or senior developer, and want to improve existing knowledge about Design Patterns, these site can help you too.
